# Current Sprint (single source of sprint truth)

**Canonical planning source for active execution:** this file.

## Sprint 1 (2026-02-16 → 2026-03-01): Foundations

- `packages/dispatch-contracts` scaffold
- Trace propagation baseline
- Temporal dev compose + worker skeleton (no mutations)
- Read-only Temporal activities (ticket/timeline fetch)
- PR title governance + Temporal spike baseline

## Active dependencies

- PR plan: `real-dispatch-agile-package/03-Delivery/03-PR-Plan.md`
- Backlog: `real-dispatch-agile-package/02-Backlog/02-Stories.md`
- PR template + checks: `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`

## Current execution focus

1. Establish the single sprint truth surface and repoint all current-work logs.
2. Enforce PR title format with both docs + CI.
3. Complete one minimal Temporal end-to-end spike (schedule hold → release) via stub activity adapter.
