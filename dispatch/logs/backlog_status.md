# Backlog Status

Canonical backlog source:

- `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/backlog/backlog.csv`

Backlog hygiene rules:

- Keep active backlog items only in the canonical CSV above.
- Do not duplicate backlog rows in this log.
- Completed story history remains in `dispatch/logs/progress_log.md`.

Current active item:

- `GLZ-04` (dispatch queue prioritization by region and urgency, with `GLZ-03` complete).
- Last completed work: `GLZ-03` (intake-to-schedulable guardrails and SOP handoff requirements).

Current planning cadence:

- Active sprint focus: `Sprint G2`.
- Active epic family: `EPIC-GZ-02` (Scheduling and Commitment) and `EPIC-GZ-01` follow-through.
