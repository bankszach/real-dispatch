  - `real-dispatch-agile-package/03-Delivery/03-PR-Plan.md`
- Blocker priority now is:
  - `E12-F1-S1` must complete before closeout + rollout handoff can be considered production-ready.
  - `E7-F2-S1` requires operator/override evidence controls and rollback proof before PR-ready controls are marked complete.
