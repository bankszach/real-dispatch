## Last Completed Story

`GLZ-11`

## Epic

`EPIC-GZ-03`

## Completion Status

`GLZ-11` remains complete in historical tracking. `GLZ-09` is now the active readiness blocker before moving to `GLZ-12`.

## Suggested Focus Area

Follow the execution order in `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/docs/12_Sprint_Plan.md` and confirm story readiness in `ai_dispatch_agile_project_package/docs/13_V0_Engineering_Readiness_Bundle.md`.

Sprint V0-3 focus now blocking V0-4:

- `GLZ-09`: blind closeout candidate heuristics, escalation triggers, and auto-close logging.
- `GLZ-12`: operator override, autonomy pause, rollback controls, and incident replay retention.
- `V0-LAUNCH-GATE`: final gate closure, closeout evidence packet, and no open P0 blockers.
