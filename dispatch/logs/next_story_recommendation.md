# Next Story Recommendation

Recommended next P0 story: `STORY-07`.

Rationale:
- `STORY-06` delivered incident template policy modeling and deterministic requirement evaluation.
- Remaining EPIC-04 gap is persisted evidence integration (API/object-store references) so template gates operate on real artifacts.
- Completing `STORY-07` next unlocks canonical missing-evidence policy-violation E2E proof in `STORY-08`.
