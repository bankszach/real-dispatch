# Workflow Engine Scaffold

This component will hold deterministic workflow rules for:

- intake completeness and triage
- scheduling and dispatch policy
- onsite evidence gating
- closeout and billing readiness

The engine should evaluate rules from authoritative case-file state, never from chat memory.
