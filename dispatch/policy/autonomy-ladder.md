# Autonomy Ladder

## Level 0: Assisted

- agent proposes actions
- operator confirms all state mutations

## Level 1: Bounded

- low-risk updates can auto-commit
- scheduling/dispatch/closeout still require confirmation

## Level 2: Operational

- role-scoped actions auto-commit within locked policy
- all exceptions escalate to operator

## Level 3: Adaptive

- agent proposes policy refinements using observed KPI patterns
- operator approval required before policy changes take effect
